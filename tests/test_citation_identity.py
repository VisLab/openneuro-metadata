"""
test_citation_identity.py — Drift detector for src/citation_identity.py.

src/citation_identity.py is a synced copy of task-research's identity.py.
The two copies must compute the same pub_id for the same input or the
cross-repo bridge to task-research/publications.json silently breaks.

These tests pin three known (family, year, title) -> pub_id triples.
The expected pub_id values were computed from the upstream identity.py
on 2026-05-01 and copied here as literals.  If a future edit to either
copy changes any of the helper functions in a way that affects pub_id,
one of these assertions will fail and the diff between the two copies
needs to be reconciled.

The triples are chosen to exercise:
  - a short title (Posner 1980)
  - a long title (Eriksen 1974)
  - a pre-DOI-era paper to stress the "no DOI required for pub_id"
    property (Stroop 1935)

Run:
    pytest tests/test_citation_identity.py -v

No network, no fixtures, no external dependencies.
